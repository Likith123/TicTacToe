> **Tic Tac Toe** is a game where 2 players can play on a 3 x 3 grid using **O** & **X** and there can be only 1 winner or a draw

- This is my personal project **Tic Tac Toe** game which can be played on a *responsive website*
- **O** is the playing option of Player 1 and **X** is the playing option of Player 2

- Here is the image of the game on my website

- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] JavaScript

- This is a responsive website so that we can play on device of any screen type and size like **PCs, Laptops, Mobiles, Tablets etc**
